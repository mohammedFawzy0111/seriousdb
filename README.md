`seriousdb` is a small, simple key-value database you import directly into your Python project. It
requires zero configuration and is designed to be effortless.

For setup, usage, architecture, persistence, and contribution guidance, see the
[documentation](docs/).

## Quick Start

### Use as a Python library

Install with pip:

```bash
pip install seriousdb
```

Or add it to a uv project:

```bash
uv add seriousdb
```

Then use it directly from your Python project:

```python
import seriousdb

seriousdb.set("name", "Alice")
print(seriousdb.get("name"))
```

The database is loaded on first use. See the [API
reference](docs/reference/generated/seriousdb.api.md) for supported operations
and [persistence](docs/persistence.md) for file handling and concurrency limits.

## Configuration

Configuration is optional and can be customized from environment variables. Copy the example file
and adjust for local development:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env` file is gitignored and should never be committed.

| Variable              | Default | Description                                        |
| --------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `SERIOUSDB_DB_FILE`   | `.sdb`  | Path to the on-disk database file.                 |
| `SERIOUSDB_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO`  | Logging level (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL). |

Set configuration before importing `seriousdb`.
